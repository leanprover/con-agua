/- `withPtrEq` is `public` but not `@[expose]`, and its whole point here
is that it is *definitionally* `k ()` — which is what
`Name.beqPtr_eq` proves.  `import all` makes that body visible **in
this module only**; that theorem is the public relay, so no importer
needs it, and the executed `Name.beq` stays the plain
`decide (· = ·)` that the kernel can still reduce. -/

# Hierarchical names

`ConLeche.Name`, the checker's own mirror of `Lean.Name` (cached hash in
a `@[computed_field]`, pointer-and-hash-guarded equality substituted by
`@[csimp]`).  Split out of `ConLeche/Kernel/Expr.lean` on 2026-09-06 so
that `ConLeche/Kernel/PropWhen.lean` — which needs names and nothing
else — can sit *below* the expression and level types.

namespace ConLeche

/-- Hierarchical names, same shape as `Lean.Name` — including the
cached hash, which lives in a `@[computed_field]` exactly as
`Lean.Name`'s does (`@[computed_field, inline] hash : Name → UInt64`,
`Init/Prelude.lean`; the C runtime stores it in the object header and
reads it with `lean_name_hash_ptr`).  Logically the field is a
*function of the value*, so it is invisible to every statement:
`DecidableEq` is still the derived structural equality, and the field
only spares the `Hashable` instance a walk (task #176 P3). -/

/-- Name equality in the official kernel's shape (task #176 P1):
**pointer** (`lean_name_eq`'s `if (n1 == n2) return true`), then the
**cached hash** (`lean_name_hash_ptr`), then the structural walk —
`_tmp/lean4-master-kernel/lean4_object.cpp:2762`.  This is the
*implementation* of `Name.beq`; `Name.beqPtr_eq` proves the two guards
redundant. -/

  ConLeche.withPtrEq a b (fun _ => a.hashData == b.hashData && decide (a = b))
    (fun h => by subst h; simp)

/-- Both guards are redundant: `withPtrEq a b k h` is *defined* as
`k ()`, and `hashData` is a function of the value, so a hash mismatch
**is** an inequality. -/
theorem Name.beqPtr_eq (a b : Name) : Name.beqPtr a b = decide (a = b) := by
  show (a.hashData == b.hashData && decide (a = b)) = decide (a = b)

  · simp [h]

/-- The executed name equality.  Definitionally `decide (a = b)` — so
the kernel, `by decide` and `#guard` still see plain structural
equality — with `beqPtr` substituted by the compiler on the strength
of the `@[csimp]` equation below. -/
def Name.beq (a b : Name) : Bool := decide (a = b)

/-- **The compiler substitution, on a kernel-checked equality.**
`@[csimp]` (not `@[implemented_by]`) is what replaces `Name.beq` by
`Name.beqPtr` in compiled code — *"do not use `implemented_by`.  If
you can prove them equal, use `csimp`"* (user ruling, 2026-09-05).
Nothing here is taken on faith: `withPtrEq a b k h` is *defined* as
`k ()` and its obligation is discharged at `beqPtr`, and `hashData` is
a function of the value, so the hash guard cannot reject an equal
pair.  `Expr.beq` is substituted the same way (`Expr.beq_eq_beqMemo`),
so no equality in the tree is an escape. -/

/-! ## Display rendering

Everything the checker prints that comes from the input — names,
strings — goes through `Display.Acc`, so no input reaches the
terminal (or a CI log, where a line starting with `::` is a workflow
command) as a control sequence, an invisible character or a spoofed
separator.  Inside the delimiters of a quoted component or string, `\`
is written `\\` and every *unsafe* character (`Display.unsafeChar`),
and the closing delimiter, as `\u{XXXX}` (upper-case hex, at least
four digits).  A rendering is capped at `Display.maxLen` characters;
what does not fit is replaced by `…[N more characters]`. -/

/-- The characters a display never prints raw: Unicode's control (Cc)
and format (Cf, Unicode 15.1) characters, the line and paragraph
separators (Zl, Zp) and every space separator (Zs) other than the
ASCII space — the C0/C1 controls and DEL, the bidi embeddings,
overrides, isolates and marks, the zero-width characters, the BOM, the
tag characters, and the spaces that look like U+0020 but are not. -/
