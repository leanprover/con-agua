# Fast prop-ness off the head symbol (task #168)

Two pure readers that answer "is this type a proposition?" / "is this
term a proof?" from the **head symbol, the arity and the residual sorts of stored
types** — no inference, no reduction, no memo.

Prop-ness is invariant under application: `zeronessOf (imax u v) =
zeronessOf v`, so the zero-ness of the sort of the type of `c a⃗` is
that of `c`'s *stored* type at every arity, over-application included.
The datum a head-symbol reader needs is therefore **one `PropWhen` per
constant** — the zero-ness of the sort of its type, read off the
residual sort of its stored type and instantiated at the use's levels
by `substPW`.

Both readers are three-valued (`some pw` = the datum, `none` = unknown,
fall back to inference).  The kernel's verdict on a datum is exactly the
slow path's `Level.isEquiv u .zero`: `pw == (.ifAllZero [])` ⟺ the
sort is zero at every valuation.

The **"definitely not a proof" arm** (`notProofFast`) needs no model theorem: refusing the
proof-irrelevance shortcut is always sound; its obligation is
kernel-level agreement with the slow path, which the landing census
records (DESIGN.md, task #168).  The **"definitely a proof" arm** is
justified by the squash regime (`prf_of_isProofFast`,
`ConLeche/Model/Rules/ProofFastSound.lean`).
