# Level helpers for the least-fixed-point constructions

A subset of a member of the axiomatic level `tg w` is a member, and
separation stays inside every level: the size bounds the least
pre-fixed families and tuples (`Derive/LfpFam.lean`,
`Derive/LfpTuple.lean`) take their carriers' formation from.  They are
stated at `tg`, not at `univ`: a subset of a type need not be a type
(task #342; the fibre space's own closure is `DropClosed`).

Everything here is over the bare `SetTheory` interface; no syntax.
