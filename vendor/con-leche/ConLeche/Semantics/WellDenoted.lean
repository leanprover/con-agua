# `WellDenoted`: the semantic invariant over `interp` (task #151 tier C; task #342)

The model's invariant on `Term`.  It holds of a term when
it holds of the subterms and one condition on the term's own shape is
met; the conditions **record what is a type** (`IsTy X := X ∈ univZero
∨ Strict X`, the sets whose members are all the point or none of them):

* an application applies a member of some function space `piR v A B`
  to a member of its domain `A`; at a proposition (`v = 0`) the fibres
  are truth values, above it the domain is a type — so in the graph
  regime the membership *pins* the domain (`piR_dom_unique`);
* a λ's domain is a type, the body is well-denoted at every value of
  the domain, and some family of types bounds it;
* a Π's domain is a type, the body is well-denoted at every value of
  the domain and denotes a type there;
* a `let` has its value well-denoted, and its body well-denoted at the
  value;
* variables, sorts, constants and the proof are always well-denoted.

The binders' regimes are read off the values by `interp` (`piV`/`lamV`);
the type clauses are what makes that reading coherent: an abstraction
is a member of its function space (`lamV_mem`) because every fibre is a
type.  The predicate transports along `inst` (`WellDenoted_inst0`); a
β step at a redex that is not the point keeps the denotation and the
invariant (`WellDenoted_beta`).

Every type fact is the semantic content of a `Sort` the checker
inferred; `IsTy_univ`, `IsTy_piV` and `IsTy_of_mem_univ` produce them.

At a redex that is not the point, from the subject's `WellDenoted`
alone: the λ is not the point (`app_pt`), so it is a graph and the
slot's function space is in the graph regime; the graph fixes its
domain (`piR_dom_unique`), so the argument lies in the λ's domain, and
β is `app_lamV`.  At the point there is nothing to show: the claims
that read this are conditional on "not the point". -/
