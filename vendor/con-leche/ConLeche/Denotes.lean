# What a checker term denotes, and what a model of an environment is

This module is the *statement* half of the main theorem: it says what it
means for the environment the checker builds to have a model in a set
theory `V`.  It is written to be read top to bottom in one sitting —
three one-line helpers, the relation `Denotes`, the structure `Model` —
and it imports nothing from the proof tiers.  The theorem itself is
stated in `ConLeche/Challenge.lean` (with `sorry`) and proved in
`ConLeche/MainTheorem.lean`.

## The relation

`Denotes cval env φ ρ e v` says: the checker term `e` denotes the set
`v`, when

* every constant `n` at every assignment `ψ` of naturals to its
  universe parameters (`LevelParam`, a name) denotes the set `cval n ψ`,
* `env` is the environment (read only to learn a constant's universe
  parameters and a structure's projection table),
* `φ` assigns a natural to every universe parameter in scope, and
* `ρ` assigns a set to every de Bruijn index (`BVarIdx`) in scope.

There is one rule per syntax form and no rule at all for a free
variable (`fvar`) or a term that does not resolve, so such a term
denotes nothing.  That is the right reading for stored constants: the
checker stores every constant's type as a **closed** term — bound
variables are de Bruijn indices under their binders, there is no
`fvar` — and the relation reads a binder's body by pushing the bound
value onto `ρ`, with no renaming and no instantiation.  A `let` is read
the same way: its value, then its body with the value pushed; its type
is not read, as no rule reads a type.

The two clauses that carry the type theory:

* **Binders read their regime off the values.**  A `∀` whose fibres
  over its domain are all truth values (`univ 0` is the set of truth
  values) denotes a truth value (the proposition "every `x ∈ A` has a
  `y ∈ B x`"); otherwise it denotes the set of dependent function
  graphs (`piV`).  A `λ` whose body denotes the proof point (`pt`) at
  every value of its domain denotes the one canonical proof; otherwise
  it denotes the literal graph of its body (`lamV`,
  `ConLeche/SetModel/Ops.lean`).  So propositions are subsets of a
  one-element set: proof irrelevance and impredicativity are built into
  the reading, and no typing is consulted.  Over an empty domain both
  read as propositions.  The bodies are read on the domain only:
  `piV`/`lamV` look at nothing else.
* **Projections read a pair chain.**  A structure value is a
  right-nested pair chain; `field i p` is its `i`-th component
  (`sfst ∘ ssnd^i`).  The chain starts with the constructor's tag, so
  field `i` of a structure (one with a projection table,
  `env.findProj?`) sits at position `i + 1`.  A projection from
  anything without a table denotes nothing.

A universe level denotes a natural (`Level.eval φ u`, the ordinary
evaluation with `imax u 0 = 0`), and `Sort u` denotes `univ u`, the
types at level `u` (below).  A constant is used at a list of
levels `us`; `Level.substFn φ ps us` is the assignment sending the
constant's own parameters `ps` to the values of `us` at `φ`
(`ConLeche/Verify/Level.lean`).  A literal denotes what its constructor
form denotes — the checker's own `natLitToConstructor`
(`n + 1` ↦ `Nat.succ (lit n)`) and `strLitToConstructor`
(`String.ofList [Char.ofNat (lit c₁), …]`).

`Denotes_functional`, proved just below the relation, states that a
term has at most one denotation, so `∃ T, Denotes … T ∧ …` below is a
statement about *the* denotation.

## The set theory

`SetTheory V` (`ConLeche/SetTheory/Core.lean`) is membership `∈ˢ` with
extensionality, pairing, union, power set, regularity, replacement, and
an ω-chain of Grothendieck universes.  The reading uses these derived
sets (`ConLeche/SetTheory/Derive/*`, each a few lines): `empty`; the
Kuratowski pair with its projections `sfst`/`ssnd`; `graph F A`, the
graph of `F` on `A`, and `app f a`, the value of a graph at a point
(`app pt _ = pt`: a proof applied to anything is a proof); `piSet A B`,
the graphs in `(x : A) → B x`; the proof point `pt`, the truth values
`truthVal p` (`{pt}` if `p`, `∅` otherwise), and `univ n`, the types
at level `n`: `univ 0` is the set of truth values, and above `0`
`univ n` holds the members of the universe `tg n` (`tg (n+1)` is the
chain's universe `n+2`) that are truth values or strict (not `pt` and
without `pt` as a member).

/-- **A model of the environment `env` in the set theory `V`**: one
assignment `cval` of a set to every constant at every level
assignment — fixed once, for the whole environment — under which every
stored constant is a member of what its type denotes, the built-in
`False` is the empty set, and the built-in `Eq` is set equality.

The interpretation of the constants *is* the model: there is nothing
else to choose (`Sort`, `∀`, `λ`, application and projection are read
by fixed set operations).  `mem` is what makes every stored theorem
true — a theorem `t : P` is a constant whose type `P` denotes a truth
value, and `cval t φ ∈ˢ ⟦P⟧` says that truth value is `{pt}` — and
`false_empty` is what makes truth mean something: a proof of `False`
would be a member of `∅`.

`False` and `Eq` are both built in (the checker installs them from its
own pins and rejects a stream that declares them otherwise), so the
last two fields are facts about the checker's own constants, not
hypotheses about the input; each is stated of whatever the stored
constant denotes, so it says nothing when nothing is stored.

The model says nothing about *definitional* equalities — a
definition's unfolding, an inductive type's iota rules, η — because it
does not have to, and `eq_equality` is what discharges that debt: any
such equality a reader cares about can be stated as a theorem `h : a = b`
and proved by `rfl`; the checker accepts it; `mem` puts `cval h φ` in
what `Eq A a b` denotes, which by `eq_equality` is `eqv ⟦a⟧ ⟦b⟧`; and
`eqv x y` is inhabited only when `x = y` (`SetTheory.eq_of_mem_eqv`).  So the
two sides of every accepted equation denote the same set.  Types are
the whole statement; values are the checker's business. -/
